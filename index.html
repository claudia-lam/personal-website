            <h1>Hi! I'm Claudia, an aspiring developer based in the bay area.</h1>
            <p>
              I am currently learning the basics of html, css, and javascript. I'm excited to learn more and will be attending Rithm School in February 2023.

          <p class="indent"> I started to learn how to code when I was building a website for my clothing brand. My mentor advised that learning basic HTML and CSS would save monthly costs on website widgets.</p>
          <p class="indent"> There were many times when I wanted to abandon coding and just buy a fancy website builder, but my budget wasn't big enough. They were just too dang expensive. </p>
          <p class="indent"> After all the struggling and mental gymnastics, I ended up enjoying coding. Looking back, I can thank those companies for their pricing. </p>
          <p class="indent">And what about my clothing brand? It never took off, but my passion for coding sure did.</p>
